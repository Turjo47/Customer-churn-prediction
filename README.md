# Customer-churn-prediction
A supervised machine learning project to predict customer churn using classification algorithms. The goal is to help business identify customers who are likely to leave their service, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Project Overview
This project uses supervised learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict churn. It includes data preprocessing, model training(Logistic Regression and Decision Tree), hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and visualizations to gain business insights.

## Machine Learning Concepts
- Supervised Learning (Classification)
- Logistic Regression & Decision Tree Classifier
- Hyperparameter Tuning(GridSearchCV)
- Feature Scaling(StandardScaler)
- label Encoding for Categorical Features
- Model Evaluation(Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Feature Importances Analysis
